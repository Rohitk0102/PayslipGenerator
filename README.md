# PayslipGenerator
PayslipGenerator is a web-based system that replaces the manual process of sending salary details via Excel sheets. It allows employees to securely view, download, and manage their payslips from a centralized platform. The system improves accessibility, accuracy, and security of payroll data while reducing administrative effort

#Project Overview

Traditionally, employee salary details were shared via Excel sheets, leading to inefficiencies, errors, and accessibility issues. PayslipGenerator solves this problem by providing a user-friendly web platform where employees can:
	•	Upload Excel files containing payroll data
	•	Input their Employee ID
	•	Instantly generate, view, print, and download their payslip

#Features
	•	Upload .xlsx files for salary data
	•	Employee ID-based payslip retrieval
	•	Structured and printable HTML payslip generation
	•	Download payslip functionality
	•	Responsive and browser-compatible UI
	•	Handles large Excel files and real-world data variations

#Tech Stack
	•	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
	•	Library: SheetJS (xlsx.js) for Excel file processing

#How It Works
	1.	HR uploads the Excel file with employee salary records
	2.	Employee enters their ID
	3.	System extracts matching data and displays a detailed payslip
	4.	Employee can print or download the payslip in a readable format
